General list of questions/ideas/things I need to figure out for project

1. Wireframe
2. Figure out best way to move through story
3. Figure out where animations will live
4. Research Anime vs Canvas for animations 
5. Do I need to build animations, or can i use prebuilt?
6. What should be in header/ do i want a header at all?
7. Landing page- what do I want on it?


Goals for Friday 2/26 
- Decide on animations to use
    - Landing page - use NEON (found here https://codepen.io/shalunts/pen/jYLapb) for  Game title. Feels like it creates a sufficiently anxious mood at the start- How do I change letters?  or https://tobiasahlin.com/moving-letters/#15  this might be easier to use
    - Start Game button using (https://codepen.io/andrewmillen/pen/MoKLob) but change colors to match Title?
    - use https://codepen.io/juliangarnier/pen/LMrRNW?editors=0010 to conveny Fear? Tie to button click in story
    - use https://codepen.io/mehmetarik/pen/dypKWYp to convey feeling stuck?
    - use for more anxious type stuff https://codepen.io/WojciechWKROPCE/pen/eYNJBjO
    - this one is just cool https://codepen.io/alexzaworski/pen/mEkvAG
    - Use React transistions for ... transistions https://reactjs.org/docs/animation.html  and page scrolling? 
- Reseach how to move through story best
    - Should it just be an a scroll through the whole story!? This would prove to be much simpler I think. Landing page with the logo and "Start Story" button. This launchs a single component. User scrolls down the page to read the story, with animations that trigger, or show along the way. This would save loading between components and might feel more seemless. Using something like this? https://codepen.io/rexjbull/pen/RwRRezq Could really amp up the emotional aspect of the story. or https://jscottsmith.github.io/react-scroll-parallax-examples/examples/parallax-example/
- Plan some story component layout/styling.
