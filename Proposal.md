### Additional Information

I am really excited to work on this project! While I originally wanted to have musical puzzles or even just prompts to allow the user to interact with Tone.js, saving their input to compile a song. I quickly realized after reading more about Tone.js that maybe be for a longer project. And in fact is seems that Tone.js doesn't play nicely with state in React. So I scaled back and tried to keep my MVP as focused as possible, and decided to using animations in place of music, and move using Tone.js to Stretch goals. I am particularly looking forward to styling this project as I haven’t done as much of that as I would like to. Along with learning more about what I can do with Tone! And of course this story is adapted from a comic story I wrote years ago and never got to do much of anything with, so I’m very happy its ended up being relevant to this project and will get to be used. Any information you have on styling in React would be much appreciated! -Update as of 3/9/21 I scaled back even further for the first iteration of this project, deciding instead to use the react-spring library to implement parallax scrolling as a way to make the story come to life. Animations will be a stretch goal, as I have yet to figure out how to place them in the parallax layers
