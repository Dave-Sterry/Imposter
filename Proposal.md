## Imposter
### David Sterry

### Description
A scrollable linear story that follows a character as they learn to deal with imposter syndrome.  Utlizing parallax scrolling each section has it's own images and background that emphasis the emotional content of that section. As the story progresses the player learns that what was confusing at the start has slowly become understandable. (Much like the process of a coding bootcamp!) with the story culminating in the character learning to accept and move past their imposter syndrome 

### Use Case
Any one who has struggled with imposter syndrome is a potential user for this project

### Minimum Viable Product

Parallax Scrolling story, with different "sections" for parts of the story
Different images and backgrounds for each story parallax "section"
Landing page with prompt to start story

### Tools for MVP

React	
React-Spring
React Bootstrap
CSS and styled components for styling 

### Additional Features
(If you finish developing your MVP and have time to spare, what features do you want to work on next? Be specific.)
Animations at story transitions 
Musical prompts/puzzles using Tone.js
Story requires either user input via Tone.js or a matching game using Tone.js to advance 
All musical prompts are saved and compiled into a song at the end of the game. 
Add users so progress can be saved
Login authentication with Google/Apple/Facebook
Volume control for sound output 
Animated background! 

### Tools for Additional Features
React Reveal and React Animations React Spring for Animations 
NoSql for storing user song and save data (i think since we haven’t learned it yet)
Tone.js for musical puzzles 
Google/Facebook/Apple authenticator 

### Additional Information

I am really excited to work on this project! While I originally wanted to have musical puzzles or even just prompts to allow the user to interact with Tone.js, saving their input to compile a song. I quickly realized after reading more about Tone.js that maybe be for a longer project. And in fact is seems that Tone.js doesn't play nicely with state in React So I scaled back and tried to keep my MVP as focused as possible, and decided to using animations in place of music, and move using Tone.js to Stretch goals. I am particularly looking forward to styling this project as I haven’t done as much of that as I would like to. Along with learning more about what I can do with Tone! And of course this story is adapted from a comic story I wrote years ago and never got to do much of anything with, so I’m very happy its ended up being relevant to this project and will get to be used. Any information you have on styling in React would be much appreciated!
